# quartic-k3-with-involution
## What is this?
In this repository we provide the code that was used in the writing of the article *D. Festi, W. Nijgh, D. Platt: K3 surfaces with two involutions and low Picard rank*.
The article exhibits examples of K3 surfaces with two involutions and Picard rank 2, which is the lowest Picard rank possible for a K3 surface that is not a double cover of P^2 branched over a sextic.
All code is written in [Magma (link)](magma.maths.usyd.edu.au).

## How to use this repository?

On a machine that has Magma installed, run in the command line: `magma` and then, once Magma has started, run `load <file>;`, where you replace `<file>` with one of the files from the repository. The runnable Magma files are explained below.

### `ExampleBranchedDoublePlane`

This code computes the Picard rank of the double cover of P^2, branched over the sextic defined by the equation f:=7*x^6+x^5*y-x^4*y^2-9*x^3*y^3+2*x^2*y^4-6*x*y^5+7*y^6+3*x^5*z
    +7*x^4*y*z+6*x^3*y^2*z-4*x^2*y^3*z-4*x*y^4*z+9*y^5*z+2*x^4*z^2
    -4*x^3*y*z^2-6*x^2*y^2*z^2-7*x*y^3*z^2+5*x^2*y*z^3+5*x*y^2*z^3
    -8*y^3*z^3-6*x^2*z^4+5*x*y*z^4+8*y^2*z^4+7*x*z^5-2*y*z^5+z^6.
This is Example 3.4 from the article.
The program computes the Picard ranks of the reductions of the K3 surface modulo 5 and modulo 13 and computes the result of the Artin-Tate formula in the two cases.
Because the values of the ArtinTateFormule do not not differ a square, this gives an upper bound of 1 for Picard rank of the original complex K3.
As the Picard rank of every algebraic K3 is at least 1, this shows that the Picard rank of this surface is equal to 1.

### `ExampleNodalK3`

This code computes the Picard rank of the blowup of the nodal K3 defined by the equation f4+f3*w+f2*w^2=0 as a subset of P^3, where 
f2:=3*x^2+9*x*y+9*y^2+7*x*z+8*y*z+8*z^2,
f3:=-8*x^3+8*x^2*y-8*x*y^2-5*y^3-9*x^2*z-x*y*z-6*y^2*z+5*x*z^2-9*y*z^2-7*z^3,
f4:=-5*x^4+5*x^3*y+4*x^2*y^2+x*y^3-4*x^3*z+8*x^2*y*z-8*x*y^2*z+7*y^3*z+
    +9*x^2*z^2-4*x*y*z^2+2*y^2*z^2-6*x*z^3+3*y*z^3-4*z^4.
This is example 4.5 from the article.
In the article, the blowup of the nodal quartic is recognised as the double cover of P^2 branched over the sextic f:=f3^2-4*f2*f4, and the program computes the Picard rank of the K3 surface using this model.
The program computes the Picard rank of the reductions of the K3 surface modulo 5 and it is found that this rank is 2, which gives an upper bound for the Picard rank.
We also have a lower bound 2, because the exceptional divisor and the hyperplane section are independent divisors, so the Picard rank of this K3 surface is equal to 2.

### `ConstructionQuartic`

Use the code `ConstructionQuartic` to generate random quartic surfaces with Picard rank at most 2 and an involution coming from a curve C of genus 2 and degree 5.
(It is shown in the article that this implies that the quartic surface has Picard rank *equal* to 2.)

### `EquationsInvolution`

Run the code `EquationsInvolution` to get the equation of the involution on the quartic which is defined in the article, and to compute the equations of the K3 surface viewed as an intersection of an intersection of three quadrics.
