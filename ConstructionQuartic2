/* 
This is the alternative construction as pointed out
by the anonymous referee.

This file finds examples of a quartic K3 surface
defined over the Rationals, with Picard number 2 and a
holomorphic involution. These examples are constructed
by generating a random curve of genus 2 in P1xP1 and 
embedding this via the Segre embedding in P3. There 
we look for a quartic surface containing this curve.
If the quartic surface is smooth it will be a K3 surface
containing a genus 2 curve. The linear system of this 
curve gives a 2-1 cover of the projective plane, 
inducing the holomorphic involution.

The function can take quite a lot of time, because it 
uses the time consuming function Deg2K3RankUpperBound. 
This is needed to check if the surface has Picard rank 2. 
If not, the process starts again so if we are unlucky 
it can take more than one hour...
